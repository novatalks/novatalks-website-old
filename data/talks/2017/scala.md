Would you like to learn programming in Scala? Scala brings JVM programming into a whole other level!

To some, Scala feels like a scripting language, its syntax is concise and low ceremony.
At the same time, Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems for companies like Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
At its root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.
This combination of paradigms, alongside powerful built-in constructs, allows you to decide your trade-offs, instead of having them set by the language.

In this hands-on workshop you will gain an understanding of the fundamentals of the Scala language and a good appreciation for some of the more advanced features.
