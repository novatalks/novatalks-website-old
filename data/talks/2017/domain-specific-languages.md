OutSystems, A Programming Language Made in Portugal

With the OutSystems platform you can develop software applications much faster than with traditional development processes and technologies. At the core of this platform is a Domain Specific Language, tailored for enterprise applications, that was created by the OutSystems Research & Development team in Portugal.

In this talk, OutSystems engineers will show how the platform works and tell the story of how the OutSystems language has evolved from the whiteboard to a fully working visual language that is being used by software developers all throughout the world.
