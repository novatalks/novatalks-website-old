You are not your job or your position. Everyone has their own unique purpose, ambitions and way of being.
In this event, NOVATalks has the pleasure of collaborating with very special guests from different backgrounds to share with what drives them to run that extra mile, what are their strategies to know and express themselves in their daily life, and how their past experiences taught them to value their inner selves and what they do.
